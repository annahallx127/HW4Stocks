Stocks our program supports: All the stocks that are supported by the API (listing_status.csv)
All dates for portfolios should be supported including holidays that are New Years or
Christmas. If the holiday is not either of the two, the program will find the nearest market
date backwards.
All dates for stock methods should be supported, if it is not a valid market date, or holiday,
it will find the nearest market date backwards.
